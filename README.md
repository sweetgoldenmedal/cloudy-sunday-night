# cloudy-sunday-night

Welcome to the cloudy-sunday-night github repo!
Changes to this repository will be automatically deployed to Circuit Playground Express running in the CraabLab.
You can find documentation about the CPX python library here: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express/neopixels

NOTES:
- Only the master branch will be deployed to the CPX.  
- Only code.py will be run by the CPX.  
- If you commit a syntax error the CPX will stop doing much of anything.  No problem, fix the error and recommit.

- 2019-10-23: 
At this point the only real objective is to test the pipeline functionality.  
We want to answer questions such as:
  - Does this pipeline work at all?
  - Does it work quickly enough to be useful?
  - What would you change?
  
Later we will need to address other questions and issues such as:
  - the potatoe video quality
  - how will we simulate people walking past our sensors?
